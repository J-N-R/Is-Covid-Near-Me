# Is Covid Near Me?
Made during the Summer of 2021 for Google's Software Product Sprint, this project allows users to search for simple, easy to understand covid results near them! Since my access to the Google App Engine expires soon, I recently migrated this to Kean's unix server, and rewrote some logic to better fit my style and comfort. Several Java servlets were rewritten using Python, and all the files are now organized in a more standard way.

## Notes
 * This was my first project which involved working the full stack! I designed the frontend and backend functions, as well as used proper CSS to make formatting as neat as possible.
 * All the data that the project uses comes from [NyTimes' Covid 19 Data Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) which is updated every day.
