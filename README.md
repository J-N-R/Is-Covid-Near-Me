# Is Covid Near Me?
## A Web Application

## Description
Made during the Summer of 2021 for Google's Software Product Sprint, this project allows users to search for simple, easy to understand covid results near them! Since my access to the Google App Engine expires soon, I recently migrated this to Kean's unix server, and rewrote some logic to better fit my style and comfort. I have rewritten several Java servlets using Python, and have organized all the files in a more standard way.

The goal of this project is to keep simplicity and usability in mind to allow almost anyone to use the tool and get the information they need served to them as quickly and easy to understand as possible.

## Notes
 * This was my first project which involved working the full stack! I designed the frontend and backend functions, as well as used proper CSS to make formatting as neat as possible.
 * All the data that the project uses comes from [NyTimes' Covid 19 Data Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) which is updated every day.
 * I have since maintained and added on to the project alone. To view the original project, please view the Google App Engine version.
